5)Why does Rubocop not complain about "Prefer single-quoted strings" on lines 6 and 7? Any thoughts?

    Yes because those single quotes are inside of a string.
    
6) You didn't fix the Robocop "Prefer single-quoted strings" offenses.

    Yes I did, I added single-quoted strings to the .yml file which you can see on github
    Checkout the .rubocop.yml file, And I did this because sometimes there are times where
    you would use "" like on number line 6 and 7 of ex1.rb
