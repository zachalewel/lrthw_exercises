This project is the exercises I did as
part of reading through Learn Ruby the 
Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw.

This work was done as a homework assignment
for the [Davinci Coders](http://www.davincicoders.com/)
class that I'm taking, titled "Building
the Toolbelt of a Junior Ruby on Rails 
Developer" taught by [Jason Noble](http://jasonnoble.org).
